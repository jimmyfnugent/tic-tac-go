# Contributing Guidelines

Deviation from this guide is off limits to those who do not wish to die a most painful death.

## Code Style

- Two space indent
- 88-character line limit


## Workflow

Commits should be done _outside_ of the `master` branch.  When a significant contribution is made, submit a pull request for your branch.
